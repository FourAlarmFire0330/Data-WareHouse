OpenFlights is a tool that let you map your flights around the world, search and filter them in all
sorts of interesting ways, calculate statistics automatically, and share your flights and trips with
friends and the entire world (if you wish). It's also the name of the open-source project to build the
tool.

Our Open Flights & Travel (OFT) database maintains flights information around the globe for all
airports and their inbound and outbound routes. The routes and flights are collected from
OpenFlights website as of January 2012. The database also stores booking transactions for
passengers during the period 01-01-2006 and 31-12-2009, and the records of membership who
joined during 01-01-2005 and 31-12-2014.The captured booking transaction data is mainly for
flights arriving and departing from Australia besides some records for other destinations. The
database tables can be found at opfl. You can, for example, execute the following query:

select * from opfl.<table_name>;
